`USS`/`PSS` memory usage explained by [eLinux.org](http://elinux.org/Android_Memory_Usage):

**USS** *(unique set size)* is the set of pages that are unique to a process. This is the amount of memory that would be freed if the application was terminated right now.

**PSS** *(proportional set size)* is the amount of memory shared with other processes, accounted in a way that the amount is divided evenly between the processes that share it. This is memory that would not be released if the process was terminated, but is indicative of the amount that this process is "contributing" to the overall memory load.

## Local Setup

 * Checkout project
 * `npm install`
 * `node lib/index.js`
 * or server `node lib/server.js`

## Roadmap

- [ ] Import dump from folder
- [x] App memory history
  - [x] Keep killed apps
  - [x] Show min/max and avg/mean for `USS`/`PSS`
- [x] GUI & graphs
- [x] about:memory details
